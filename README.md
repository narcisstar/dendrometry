# dendrometry - Computation of Biodiversity Indices, Dendrometric and Structural Parameters

dendrometry is an R package designed to facilitate the computation of dendrometric and structural parameters as well as biodiversity indices from forest inventory data. It serves as a valuable tool for researchers, ecologists, foresters, statisticians, loggers, and anyone working with forest inventory data. In addition to these parameters, the package also includes features for converting angle values from degrees to radians, converting angles to slopes (in percentage), and determining principal angles. Position and dispersion parameters commonly used in forest studies are implemented, along with tools for computing Fibonacci series, its extensions, and the Golden Number.

## Features

- Dendrometric Parameters: Calculate key forest inventory parameters, such as tree height, diameter, volume, basal area, and more.

- Angle Conversion: Easily convert angle values from degrees to radians and vice versa.

- Slope Calculation: Compute slopes from angle values and their reciprocals, expressed in percentages.

- Principal Angle Determination: Determine the principal angle of a set of angles.

- Position and Dispersion Parameters: Implement various position and dispersion parameters used in forest studies.

- Fibonacci Series: Utilize the Fibonacci series and its extensions for different applications.

- Golden Number Computation: Access tools for computing the Golden Number, a mathematical constant with unique properties.

## Installation

You can install dendrometry from CRAN using the following command:

```R
install.packages("dendrometry")
